I am an Honors Biological Sciences student with minors in Anthropology and Neuroscience. My research interests are dominantly animal-focused, including the ethical debate regarding animal research, evolution, and animal behavior. Outside of the research realm, I am always listening to music, spending time with my loved ones, or going out for a coffee run.
