I am a Lithuanian population geneticist broadly interested in how genetic interactions shape the evolutionary process. I finished my BsC at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX, and obtained my PhD at the University of Texas at Austin under the tutelage of Mark Kirkpatrick. I am a biologist who uses math to develop a better intuition and understanding of how the evolutionary process works, which means my work incorporates math, synthetic data sets and genomic approaches. I am currently an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut at Storrs. 

See my CV for a more extensive biography.

_Teaching_

At UConn, I have been teaching EEB 2254W, Evolutionary Biology (EEB 2245) and Population Genetics (EEB 5). 

Links for any public materials for the courses are available in the Projects tab.

_Outside of work_

Outside of the classroom, I love to run, hike, brew beer and play board games.

_Fun facts_

I grew up moving across Europe, so I still maintain a conversational level of French and Russian, as well as native proficiency in Lithuanian. I don't get to speak any of these languages as much as I'd like to, so if you speak any of them, come grab coffee with me so I don't continue to degrade!
