## Background
I am a Lithuanian population geneticist broadly interested in how genetic interactions shape the evolutionary process. I finished my BsC at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX, and obtained my PhD at the University of Texas at Austin under the tutelage of Mark Kirkpatrick. I am a biologist who uses math to develop a better intuition and understanding of how the evolutionary process works, which means my work incorporates math, synthetic data sets and genomic approaches.

## Teaching

At UConn, I have been teaching EEB 2254W, Evolutionary Biology (EEB 2245) and Population Genetics (EEB 5). 

## Outside of work

Outside of the classroom, I love to run, hike, brew beer and play board games.

## Fun facts

I grew up moving across Europe, so I still maintain a conversational level of French and Russian, as well as native proficiency in Lithuanian. I don't get to speak any of these languages as much as I'd like to, so if you speak any of them, come grab coffee with me so I don't continue to degrade!
