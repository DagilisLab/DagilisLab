I’m an Environmental Science student with a minor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut. My research interests lie in the behavior, ecology, and evolution of great apes, and I’m passionate about applying this knowledge to support their conservation. Outside of my studies and research, I love learning to play musical instruments.
