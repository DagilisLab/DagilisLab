I am a senior undergraduate student studying Molecular and Cell Biology and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with a minor in bioinformatics. During my time at UConn, I've developed an interest in hybridization and speciation, specifically in lungless salamanders (<i>Batrachoseps nigriventris</i>). 
Outside of science, I enjoy fencing, cycling, and crocheting.
