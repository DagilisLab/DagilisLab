I am a senior undergraduate student studying molecular and cell biology and ecology and evolutionary biology with a minor in bioinformatics. During my time at UConn, I've developed an interest in hybridization and speciation, specifically in lungless salamanders. Outside of science, I enjoy fencing, cycling, and crocheting.
