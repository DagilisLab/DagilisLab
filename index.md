The lab is currently working on projects investigating population genetics of pathogenic fungi, the co-evolution of genes across many different species groups as well as the co-introgression of genes within species. We embrace open science and try to make any of our datasets/analyses as useful for others as possible. See our projects page for links to those projects.
